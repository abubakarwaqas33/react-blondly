                            We wouldn‚Äôt expect you to invest your money in something that hadn‚Äôt been audited. That just doesn‚Äôt feel right. Feta token is being audited by Dessert Finance. That includes a review of our smart contract and all our associated socials. As soon as the audit is done, you'll be able to find the results and recommendations from the audit in the Audit section below.
