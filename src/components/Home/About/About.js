                            Superpunks are super so you have the opportunity to ‚Äòsave‚Äô civilians with your NFT. What does that ultimately mean? It means you can, by holding and owning Superpunk, earn tokens. The staking mechanism (‚Äúsaving‚Äù) of civilians is fairly simple, however, we have explained it in more detail below.
